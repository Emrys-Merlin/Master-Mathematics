@misc{Wise,
abstract = {These notes aim to provide an introduction to the geomet-
ric  group  theory  woven  around  nonpositively  curved  cube  complexes. The main goal is to outline the proof that a hyperbolic group
G
with
a quasiconvex hierarchy has a  nite index subgroup that embeds in a
right-angled Artin group.  We sketch the supporting ingredients of the
proof:  The  basics  of nonpositively  curved  cube  complexes,  wallspaces
and dual CAT(0) cube complexes, special cube complexes, the combi-
nation theorem for special cube complexes, the combination theorem for cubulated groups, cubical small-cancellation theory, and the malnormal special quotient theorem.  We also discuss generalizations to relatively hyperbolic groups. Finally, we describe applications towards Baumslag's conjecture on the residual  niteness of one-relator groups with torsion, and to the virtual specialness and virtual  bering of certain hyperbolic
3-manifolds, including those with at least one cusp.},
