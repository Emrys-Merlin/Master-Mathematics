abstract = {These notes aim to provide an introduction to the geomet-
ric  group  theory  woven  around  nonpositively  curved  cube  complexes. The main goal is to outline the proof that a hyperbolic group
G
with
a quasiconvex hierarchy has a  nite index subgroup that embeds in a
right-angled Artin group.  We sketch the supporting ingredients of the
proof:  The  basics  of nonpositively  curved  cube  complexes,  wallspaces
and dual CAT(0) cube complexes, special cube complexes, the combi-
nation theorem for special cube complexes, the combination theorem for cubulated groups, cubical small-cancellation theory, and the malnormal special quotient theorem.  We also discuss generalizations to relatively hyperbolic groups. Finally, we describe applications towards Baumslag's conjecture on the residual  niteness of one-relator groups with torsion, and to the virtual specialness and virtual  bering of certain hyperbolic
3-manifolds, including those with at least one cusp.},

abstract = {At the present time, the average undergraduate mathematics major findsmathematics heavily compartmentalized. After Calculus, students take coursesin analysis and algebra, and depending on their interest, they take courses inspecial topics. If the student is exposed to topology, it is usuallystraightforward point set topology; if the student is exposed to geometry, itis usually classical differential geometry.These notes are an attempt to break up this compartmentalization, at least intopology-geometry. What the student has learned in algebra and advancedcalculus are used to prove some fairly deep results relating geometry,topology and group theory. The material studied includes De Rhams's theorem,the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces, the functional relation of fundamentalgroup to covering space, and surfaces of constant curvature as homogeneousspaces.},

@article{Bader2006,
abstract = {We propose a new approach to superrigidity phenomena and implement it for lattice representations and measurable cocycles with homeomorphisms of the circle as the target group. We are motivated by Ghys' theorem stating that any representation {\$}\backslashro:\backslashGamma\backslashto\backslashHomeo{\_}+(S{\^{}}1){\$} of an irreducible lattice {\$}\backslashGamma{\$} in a semi-simple real Lie group {\$}G{\$} of higher rank, either has a finite orbit or, up to a semi-conjugacy, extends to {\$}G{\$} which acts through an epimorphism {\$}G\backslashto\backslashPSL{\_}{\{}2{\}}(\backslashRR){\$}. Our approach, based on the study of abstract boundary theory and, specifically, on the notion of a generalized Weyl group, allows: (A) to prove a similar superrigidity result for irreducible lattices in products {\$}G=G{\_}{\{}1{\}}\backslashtimes... G{\_}{\{}n{\}}{\$} of {\$}n\backslashge 2{\$} general locally compact groups, (B) to give a new (shorter) proof of Ghys' theorem, (C) to establish a commensurator superrigidity for general locally compact groups, (D) to prove first superrigidity theorems for {\$}\backslashtilde{\{}A{\}}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} groups. This approach generalizes to the setting of measurable circle bundles; in this context we prove cocycle versions of (A), (B) and (D). This is the first part of a broader project of studying superrigidity via generalized Weyl groups.},
