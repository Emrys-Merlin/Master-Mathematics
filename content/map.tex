\section{The boundary map}

\begin{thm}[\cite{MR3509968}]\todo{irreducible}\todo{essential action}\todo{non-elementary action}\todo{strong \(\Gamma\)-boundary}\todo{non-terminating ultrafilters}
  Let \(\Gamma \to \Aut(Y)\) be a group action on an irreducible finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex \(Y\). Assume the action is essential and non-elementary. If \(B\) is a strong \(\Gamma\)-boundary, there exists a \(\Gamma\)-equivariant measurable map \(\phi\colon B \to \partial Y\) taking values in the non-terminating ultrafilters in \(\partial Y\).
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  By Corollary~\ref{cor:p(x)}, we yield a \(\Gamma\)-equivariant measurable map \(\psi\colon B \to \mathcal{P}(\bar X)\). Via this map we can pushforward the probability measure \(\vartheta\) on \(B\) to \(\mathcal{P}(\bar X)\). With the help of Proposition~\ref{prop:coeff-ergodic} and Lemma~\ref{lemma:ergodicity-pushforward} \(\mathcal{P}(\bar X)\) becomes (doubly) ergodic with regard to the \(\Gamma\) action. 
\end{proof}

\begin{cor}[\cite{MR3509968}]
  Let \(\Gamma \to \Aut(X)\) be a group acting on a finite dimensional CAT(0) cube complex \(X\). Assume that ther is no finite orbit in the visual boundary \(\partial_\sphericalangle X\) and denote by \(Y\) the essential core of \(X\). Then there exists a \(\Gamma\)-equivariant measurable map \(\phi \colon B \to \partial Y \subseteq \partial X\).
\end{cor}
